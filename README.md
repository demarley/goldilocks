The "not too boosted, not too resolved" top tagger

Tagging top quarks in the semi-merged regime.  
Built for CMS analyses considering a wide pT-range of top quark decays:  
A large-R jet (AK8) is paired with a small-R jet (AK4) to reconstruct the top quark.

The following describes steps necessary to setup the tagger in a CMSSW environment.  
_The current setup does not use the Producer/Analyzer model, thus porting this to a "Standalone" setup outside of CMSSW should be straightforward_

## Getting Started

CMSSW release: `CMSSW_8_0_28_patch1`
