The "not too boosted, not too resolved" top tagger

Tagging top quarks in the semi-merged regime.  
Built for CMS analyses considering wide pT-range of top quark decays.  
A large-R jet (AK8) is paired with a small-R jet (AK4) to reconstruct the top quark.

The following describes steps necessary to setup the tagger in a CMSSW environment.  

## Getting Started
